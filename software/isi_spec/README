====================================
Running the ISI Digital Spectrometer
====================================

Before starting a series of observations, program the FPGA:
$ ./run_spec.py -p

For each new observation, update any header fields in fits.cfg:
$ vi fits.cfg
Be sure to set the source name and observation duration.

To take data:
$ ./run_spec.py

Data is saved as a FITS file:
  $PATH/$DATE/$SOURCE/$TIME.fits
where:
  $PATH   is specified in spec.cfg
  $DATE   is the UTC date, in YYYYMmmDD
  $SOURCE is specified in fits.cfg
  $TIME   is the UTC time, in yearseconds
